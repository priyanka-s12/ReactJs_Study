        Taj Mahal was built between 1631 and 1648 and is the result of the
        profound love Emperor Shah Jahan had for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Mumtaz
        Mahal died during child birth. It took over 20,000 workers and artisans
        to complete this magnificent structure.

        The Taj Mahal is a testament to the artistry of Mughal architecture and
        has rich history, including surviving wars and natural disasters.
